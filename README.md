A parametric 3D printable spank paddle for punishing and brat taming.
Features spikes one one side and embossed text on the other.

#### How the grip was made

I scanned in a hairbrush using my flatbed scanner. In gimp I changed the picture to be just a
silhouette (contrast & brightness, bucket fill, etc.) and converted it to a 1-bit black and white
image at the end. That Image I pasted into inkscape where I did a bitmap trace to transform it into
a vector object. The object I converted into a path which I combined with a rectangle to slice it in
half lengthwise. I saved it as an SVG, imported it in OpenSCAD and used `rotate_extrude` to convert
it into a 3d object. which I then integrated with the rest of the design.
