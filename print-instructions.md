Use 4+ perimeters and increase bottom solid layers for added rigidity.
Use 80% infill for added strength and weight.

Can be printed without supports. If slicer complains about long bridging extrusions, it's because of the text. Due to that, the text might not be 100% dimmensinally acrate, but that doesn't matter much.

***Note:** Below instructions are only theory for now, I haven't tried 'em out just yet. I will update these instructions once I did some testing.*

If you want to increase the weight even further use 15% gyroid infill.
Once the print is done, drill a hole in the side and fill some sand or table salt into the model an seal the hole afterwards.
If you only fill it partially, it allows the sand/salt to move around increasing the impact strenth.
